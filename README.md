# Drive Document Tagging Add-on
This Google Drive add-on makes it easy to add "tags" to your files for easier searching. Managing tags through the add-on also helps to ensure the tags are consistent across files.

## How to use it
After creating your available tags Sheet (see below), select it using the add-on UI.

Only available tags from the Sheet can be used, so edit the document and reload the tags using the add-on UI if needed.

## Setup
Create a Google Sheet containing your tags in the first column. Be sure to include a column header.

You will likely want to use a unique value to get the best search results, as shown in the example above.

You'll then need to select the document containing the tags using the add-on UI.

## How it works
The tags are saved in a comma delimited list in the document's Description field. You can see the data in the file browser by clicking on the "i" in the upper-right corner.
